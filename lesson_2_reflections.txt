When I initialize a repository a git repository (.git) is created but no commit is created. Why do I need to do it?
Staging area is a temporary location between a working directory and repository where you can add or remove file(s) before being committed to a repository. The value it offers is that you can undo adding a file that you might think should not go to the repository.
I can use staging area to make sure that I have one commit per logical change: After doing all the changes to the files in the working directory I can compare the working directory and staging area using git diff and review all the changes. And then I can decide which changes I should add/remove to the staging area for one logical change before I make a final decision to commit.
Situations when branches would be helpful in keeping history organized are when I want to create different versions of the program such as experimental or easier version than the main/master version. Branches help because I can work on different multiple versions of the program.
The diagrams help me visualize the branch structure by showing all the commits and their reachability.
The result of merging two branches together is combining two branches into a single branch. We represent the diagram that way because it shows the relationship between each commit and its parent.
Pros of Gits automatic merging vs always doing merges manually: Faster with no less headache.
Cons of Gits automatic merging vs always doing merges manually: Some branches cannot merge automatically so we have to manually inspect the code to decide which lines of code should be deleted and which should remain.
