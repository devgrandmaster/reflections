When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository so that I can share my work with other people and collaborate with other people on my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might want to pull changes manually because before pulling the changes I need to find out first whether I like the changes or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy of a repository on another GitHub account.
Clone is a copy of a repository from GitHub or computer in another computer.
A branch is another version of the project within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows me to update the local copy of the remote branch and I don't have to combine them right away. And then I can access the updates on the remote even if I don't have Internet connection (such as in a plane or forest).
