When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository so that I can share my work with other people and collaborate with other people on my project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might want to pull changes manually because before pulling the changes I need to find out first whether I like the changes or not.
